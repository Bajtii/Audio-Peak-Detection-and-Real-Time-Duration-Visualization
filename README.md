🎸 Audio Peak Detection & Real-Time Duration Visualization – Python Project
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on audio signal analysis and real-time visualization of transient sound events such as guitar string plucks.
The system detects temporal peaks in an audio signal, computes their durations, and visualizes them dynamically while the audio is being played.

The project combines digital signal processing (DSP) techniques with real-time animation and audio playback synchronization, providing both offline analysis and live visualization.

The project workflow is divided into the following stages:
